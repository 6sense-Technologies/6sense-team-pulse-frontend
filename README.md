## Deployment

The recommended deployment platform is **Vercel**. Refer to the [Next.js Deployment Guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

### Deploying with Vercel CLI

1. Install Vercel CLI if you havenâ€™t already:
   
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Login to Vercel:
   
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

   Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Vercel account.

3. Navigate to your project directory and deploy:
   
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

   This will initialize the deployment process and prompt you with options.

4. For deploying updates, use:
   
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Deploying to Development and Preview Environments

- **Development Environment:**
  
  ```bash
  vercel --env development
  ```
  
  This helps in testing changes before pushing them to production.

- **Preview Deployment:**
  
  ```bash
  vercel --pre
  ```
  
  This will deploy the branch as a preview, which can be shared and tested before going live.

### Assigning a Custom Domain

- **Add your domain to Vercel:**
  
  ```bash
  vercel domains add yourdomain.com
  ```

- **Update your DNS settings** by following the instructions provided by Vercel.

- **Set the domain for production:**

  vercel domains inspect yourdomain.com
  ```

### Logging Out
